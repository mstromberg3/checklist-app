# checklist-app
Create a custom checklist that will save into your browser.

This is a work in progress for a multi-list page with different sections for different types of tasks. It will come with a default list of tasks for each area, but will be customizable for the user to add, delete, or check off items. 

For this reason, you may see some variable names that don't make a lot of sense yet, but they're placeholders until the next version.

Open to help and feedback!
